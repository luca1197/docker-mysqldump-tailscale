# docker-tailscale-mysqldump

## Running
The container requires your input for the Tailscale and MySQL connection. These details need to be set using environment variables, for which an example is provided in the `.env.example` file.

After the container is done dumping, the dump is written to `/tmp/mysqldump/dump.sql` in the containers file system. There are several ways to access this file on the host:
* Using `docker cp` (`docker cp <containerId>:/tmp/mysqldump/dump.sql ./somehwere-on-the-host/dump.sql`)
* Using a bind mount to `/tmp/mysqldump` (`./somewhere-on-the-host:/tmp/mysqldump`)
* ... your own way âœ¨ ...

If you enabled compression by setting the `DUMP_COMPRESS` environment variable to anything non-empty, the dump will be gzip-compressed to `/tmp/mysqldump/dump.sql.gz`.
